#### Photography tips

- Use RAW format
- Metering mode: Center weighted average
- Color temperature K 2800-4000
- Focus at infinity
- Aperture f2.8 preferred. f3.5 or f4 also work well
- ISO as low as possible. Start at 400-800. If it's too dark increase to 1200. Do not exceed 4000.
- If the aurora moves quickly 5-7 seconds exposure
- If the aurora moves slower 10-25 seconds
