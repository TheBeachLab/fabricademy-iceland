# Travel journal

I arrived to Iceland a few days before the start of the bootcamp. My initial plan was renting a car and traveling around on my own, spending the nights in hotels. That was until I checked the price of accommodation. Nothing below 150 EUR. Then I changed my mind and instead of renting a car, I rented a camper for six days for 320 EUR. A legendary Jimny 4x4 with a roof tent. That was the moment I stopped being a tourist and became a explorer.
